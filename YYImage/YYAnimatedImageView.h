/**
 An image view for displaying animated image.
 
 @discussion It is a fully compatible `UIImageView` subclass.
 If the `image` or `highlightedImage` property adopt to the `YYAnimatedImage` protocol,
 then it can be used to play the multi-frame animation. The animation can also be 
 controlled with the UIImageView methods `-startAnimating`, `-stopAnimating` and `-isAnimating`.
 
 This view request the frame data just in time. When the device has enough free memory, 
 this view may cache some or all future frames in an inner buffer for lower CPU cost.
 Buffer size is dynamically adjusted based on the current state of the device memory.
 
 Sample Code:
 
     // ani@3x.gif
     YYImage *image = [YYImage imageNamed:@"ani"];
     YYAnimatedImageView *imageView = [YYAnimatedImageView alloc] initWithImage:image];
     [view addSubView:imageView];
 */

 play/stop the animation when the view become visible/invisible.

 the max buffer size will be dynamically adjusted based on the current state of 
 the device free memory. Otherwise, the buffer size will be limited by this value.

 immediately, and may grow back at the right time.
